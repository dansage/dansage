### Prior projects
- **CB Tools (Chromebook Tools)**  
  A high performance tool to collect, summarize, and present statistics about user sessions on each device in a
  fleet of Chromebooks. This tool started as a simple dashboard tool written in PHP using Laravel but quickly
  outgrew the stack (at least on that hardware) and was rewritten from scratch in Go using the [Labstack Echo][2]
  framework. The project has never been publicly released due deep integration with its original environment.


- **HS Resource**  
  An easy-to-use student attendance tracking application designed to work alongside an existing SIS (student
  information system). Like CB Tools, this project started as a Laravel application but was also rewritten in
  Go using the [Fiber][3] framework. The project is currently in use at [CUSD 200][1] and will be publicly
  released in the near future as initial setup is streamlined and features are finalized.

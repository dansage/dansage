# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel
I am software developer with networking and technical support experience in the suburbs of Chicago, IL.

- In my free time I am expanding my knowledge of Go and coming up with ways to automate network management

### Notable projects
Most of the projects I work on remain private and never see a single public release, but all of the projects
here are notable because they solved a particular problem where all other solutions were incomplete or cost
prohibitive.

- **CB Tools (Chromebook Tools)**  
  A high performance tool to collect, summarize, and present statistics about user sessions on each device in a
  fleet of Chromebooks. This tool started as a way to identify unused devices in a K-12 environment to minimize
  waste but quickly became a vital inventory tool that helped locate hundreds of missing devices near the end of
  remote learning for a local school district. The entire application is written in Go and is deployed in a single
  executable file.

- **HS Resource**  
  A student attendance tracking application designed to import roster data directly from a SIS and provide a
  simple interface for student supervisors to indicate when students arrive at their resource room for additional
  support. The included reporting interfaces allow for fine-grained filtering of attendance data to aid school
  administrators in absence management and resource room utiliziation monitoring. All user authentication and
  provisioning is handled in the background via an integration with Google Workspace.
